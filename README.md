# WIDS-NetWeaver
Welcome folks to the Winter in Data Science Project - NetWeaver.We will begin from scratch and move on step by step.The content will be posted week by week here.
## **Week 1** 
  This week we will focus on learning Python,NumPy and Matplotlib.So for folks who dont know what all these things are lets have a brief introduction.
Python is a popular programming language which is extensilvely used in ML.NumPy and Matplotlib are its two libraries.NumPy is used for array manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.
For more details on these please go through the [week1_README.md](https://github.com/PiyushiAnand/WIDS-NetWeaver/blob/main/week1_README.md)  
Some guidelines for resources:  
1)Python has to be done completely.  
2)NumPy doing till "Random Permutation" is sufficient.  
3)Matplotlib is pretty short and can be completed quickly.  
## **Week 2** 
  This week you are required to do a coursera course on supervised machine learning.Starting with this you are officially stepping into the world of Machine Learning.This week will be mostly focussed on the theory part.All of you are advised to go through the course very nicely and make notes as well as it will help you understand what you are actually doing in the project.

### Please go through the following content step by step:
* **Week 1: [Python](https://scrimba.com/learn/python),[Numpy](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) and Data Visualization with [Matplotlib](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp)**
* **Week 2: [Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1)**
* **Week 3: [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0)**
* **Colab Notebook Tutorial** : (https://youtu.be/RLYoEyIHL6A?si=mc9GV0_nhfB_CYRg)
* **Jupyter Notebook Tutorial** : (https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk?si=eW6kwawlI2OOHShI)
## **Week 3**
  This week you will learn about Neural Networks.The videos might seem too much but are very short and can be completed.Alternatively [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw&list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1) are also great.First 10 videos are sufficient for the purpose of this project but intersted peeps can watch the complete playlist if they want :).
## **Week 4**
  Here comes the final implementation and the end to this month-long journey!This is the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OMsh7J3AkkTF97XkzM2ePifJOmG-2xrO/view?usp=sharing) you require to solve the assignment and this is the link to the [final assignment](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FVU5WKiniS107_s524RyMt6GbED7Bmo7?usp=sharing).PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE ORIGINAL ASSIGNMENT EITHER MAKE A COPY IN DRIVE OR DOWNLOAD IT AS .ipynb FILE.
### Note
You are free to use either of the two platforms for coding(Jupyter or Colab) whichever is easy to use.Make sure you learn atleast one of them as you have to do the final assignment using one of these platforms.
